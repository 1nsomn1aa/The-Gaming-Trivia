## Features

**Design**

The idea for the design came largely from my previous experience playing the "Jackbox" games. The design tried to achieve the cartoony look using the drawn brick background and cartoony looking fonts. The colors were selected to match the background as well as to have an excellent contrast ratio.

*The cartoony wall background*

**Typography**

Initially the 'Rowdies' font was selected for the entire website, but later was replaced by 'Bangers' in most sections of the page because it looked more caricatured. Lastly, the 'Orbitron' font was added because of its "digital" look and was used to display the score on the clock.

![fonts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a53b78fe-ed03-4ce4-a69e-ef7d21874c93)

**Landing Page**

The landing page looks cartoony and displays the logo as a neon wall sign, a drawn TV that has a GIF on the screen which indicates that the game has not started yet and a cable leading to the wall outlet. At the bottom it has an input field with a suggestion above it to show players where to input their desired user name. Finally, a slowly growing and shrinking "Start!" button which attracts user attention and indicates where to press if the user wants to start the game.

**Topic Selection**

After the user inputs their username and clicks on the start button, the topic selection page will appear allowing the user to select one of the four topics. By clicking on the topics, a short description of the selected topic will appear below. Lastly, when the user is satisfied with their choice, they can press the growing / shrinking start button at the bottom to start the game.

**The Game**

The game page has a similar layout to the topic page with the addition of the "score" clock, the TV screen which displays the current question and the available answers below. After the user reads the question and selects an answer, a JavaScript function "alert" will appear which will display whether the answer was correct or not.

*NOTE: The alert was created by "sweetAlerts" and is credited at the bottom of this readme file in the credits secion.*

**Ending**

After the game has ended, the TV will display the users name, which they typed in at the beginning of the game, and the final correct and incorrect answer scores. 

The username is saved in the sesion storage and will be re-used if the user clicks on the button "BACK TO TOPICS" and plays again.

**404 Page**

Lastly, the 404 page was created in order to display to the user that they have made an error in the URL or in case of an unknown bug on the website.

The user is presented with a button at the bottom "Click Here" which will take him back to the main page. Clicking on the neon sign also works on any of the pages to immediately be taken to the home page.

## Validator Testing

The code of the **deployed** website was checked for errors using the official W3C Markup Validation Service and JSHint:

*Every HTML file was checked by W3C using Direct Input and URL. No errors or warnings were found.*

![htmlcheck](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc1b7f45-01ce-4b96-bedb-5cee754308ed)

*CSS was checked using Direct Input and URL methods. No errors or warnings were found.*

![csscheck](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33f37c2f-662f-4127-a74b-0f11c699d06d)

*JavaScript was checked using JSHint and showed one warning, one undefined variable and 11 unused variables.*

- The single warning warns about the use of outer scoped variables.
- Undefined variable is shown because of an external script called "Sweet Alert", which was used to change the appearance of the "alert" function in JavaScript.
- 11 Unused variables are shown because they are used to redirect to a different page on click.

## Testing

I used **Chrome DevTools Lighthouse** test to establish scores for *performance*, *accessibility*, *best practices* and *SEO* of my **deployed** website.

## Bugs

During the development of this game, I've encountered numerous bugs with my JavaScript code, but with the help of the LMS, YouTube, GitHub, coding forums and other available material on the internet I managed to find a solution to all of them.

I've tested the website with many different devices and tried to find a way to break it but were unable to do so.

Therefore to my knowledge, there are currently no bugs on this website and everything works as it should.

To see my development process and bug fixes, please follow [this](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/The-Gaming-Trivia/commits/main/) link to my GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

The overall experience of this project was slightly overwhelming due to the difficulty of understanding JavaScript. Because of that reason the project did not meet my expectations.

**Things to improve:**
- Performance scores could be increased marginally by optimising files thus decreasing load times and increasing the performance score.
    - .PNG files could be converted to .WEBP
    - .GIF files could be converted to .MP4 or .WEBP 
    - .JS files could be minimized

- Design could be improved to make the website achieve the "cartoony" look better.
    - Changing the "No Signal" GIF to a more caricatured representation
    - Sizing of elements could be improved
    - Adding more elements to the background to make it appear less empty, especially on desktop.

- More content could be added to make the game more interesting to play.
    - More topics to choose from
    - Increasing the amount of questions every topic has
    - Creating difficulty settings for each topic
    - Leaderboard for players scores

Overall, as much as it was a struggle to complete this project, I'm glad I did. It was hard learning JavaScript but fun at the same time once the ideas started to click. Hopefully this will become easier as time goes on and I complete more projects.
